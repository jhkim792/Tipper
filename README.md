# Tipper



8/10/17
Time allotted so far : ~3 hours

Whats done: Functional tip calculator with custom tip changer and rudimentary styling. Non-functional settings page

Things to do:
1. Make the default tipper in the settings work correctly.
2. Add split bill features in the settings.
3. Scrolling left and right on the Bill total to increase or decrease tip amount.
4. UI changes and styling transitions.

Ideas for possible future:
1. Have a custom form creation that allows manual splitting of the bill per input. ie: allow for putting together of many different inputs in case someone had a more expensive dish. Compare that with the total and split the rest from there.
2. Loan tracker (Moochr?).
